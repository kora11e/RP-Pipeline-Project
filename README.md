# Haare Algorithm Implementation Project
A final project for reproducible research classes by Karol R. and Jan Åš.

The project implements the Robust Face Classifier Algorithm with Haare Feature Selector, Cumulative Sum image processing and Weak Classifier/ The final solution is presented based on te Jupyter Notebook as well as pdf and html output.

<h2>How to install the packages necessary to run the code?</h2>
The project was developed on Windows operating system. It utilizes venv package for creating virtual environments. If it's not present on Your machine, please run code from step 1 in order to install it. Else You can skip the first step.

1. Open terminal and run the installation command via package manager for Python Language called pip.

```python
pip install virtualenv
```

2. Clone fork or downlaod the repository on your machine using git bash, github desktop or downloading it from the top right corner of this page.

3. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder RP-Pipeline-Project.
   Create virtual Environment by running following command:

```python
python -m venv myenv 
```

4. Activate the environment

```python
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Install packages based on requirements.txt file:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. If all steps were fulfilled, the code should run in local environment.

7. Alternatively, you can install the libraires manually if you don't want to craete virtual environment.
